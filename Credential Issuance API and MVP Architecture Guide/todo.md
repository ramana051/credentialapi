# Digital Credentials Platform - Project Plan

## Phase 1: Comprehensive System Architecture and Technology Stack Definition
- [ ] Define overall system architecture (e.g., microservices, monolithic)
- [ ] Select primary technology stack (backend, frontend, database, authentication)
- [ ] Outline key architectural patterns and principles (e.g., API Gateway, message queues)
- [ ] Address scalability and reliability considerations
- [ ] Detail security considerations and compliance (GDPR, RBAC, JWT)
- [ ] Propose blockchain/DID integration strategy (if applicable)
- [ ] Document architectural decisions and justifications

## Phase 2: Core Project Setup and Infrastructure
- [x] Set up project repositories and version control
- [x] Configure development, staging, and production environments
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipelines
- [x] Set up Docker and Kubernetes configurations

## Phase 3: Database Schema Design and Implementation
- [x] Design database schemas for all core entities (credentials, users, templates, analytics)
- [x] Implement database migrations
- [x] Set up database backup and restore procedures

## Phase 4: Credential Issuance Module Development (UI & API)
- [x] Develop API endpoints for single and bulk credential issuance
- [x] Implement UI for credential creation and management
- [x] Integrate with credential metadata schema
- [x] Generate verifiable digital credentials (PDF/PNG, JSON-LD)

## Phase 5: Verification System Development (Public/Private Pages, QR, Blockchain Integration)
- [x] Develop public and private credential verification pages
- [x] Generate unique QR codes/URLs for each credential
- [x] Implement optional blockchain-based verification
## Phase 6: Design Studio Development (Drag-and-Drop Template Editor)
- [x] Develop a drag-and-drop/WYSIWYG editor for certificate/badge design
- [x] Implement features for uploading custom assets (logos, signatures, backgrounds)
- [x] Create template management system with versioning and publishing workflow

## Phase 7: Recipient Portal and Earners Directory Development
- [x] Develop recipient portal for viewing, downloading, and sharing credentials
- [x] Implement privacy controls for recipients
- [x] Create an earners directory with search functionality

## Phase 8: Analytics Dashboard Development
- [ ] Implement tracking for credential views, verification events, social shares
- [ ] Develop an analytics dashboard for data visualization
- [ ] Implement export functionality for reports (CSV/Excel)

## Phase 9: User Roles, Security, and Compliance Implementation
- [ ] Implement comprehensive user role management (Super Admin, Issuer Admin, Verifier, Recipient)
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication and OAuth2 for SSO
- [ ] Ensure GDPR compliance for user data handling
- [ ] Implement secure credential URL generation (UUIDs)

## Phase 10: Integration Module Development (Email, WhatsApp, SSO, Social Sharing, Webhooks)
- [ ] Integrate with email services (SMTP, SendGrid, AWS SES) for delivery
- [ ] Integrate with WhatsApp API (Twilio) for direct delivery
- [ ] Implement social sharing buttons
- [ ] Develop API/Webhooks for LMS/HR system integration

## Phase 11: Scalability, Reliability, Testing, and Deployment Strategy
- [ ] Implement microservices-compatible architecture where appropriate
- [ ] Prepare for cloud-native deployment (Docker/Kubernetes)
- [ ] Develop comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- [ ] Document deployment procedures and runbooks
- [ ] Outline strategies for high availability and disaster recovery
